# BrandonZega-Resume

The purpose of this project is to create a website that could easily be edited to be a personal resume.
The features I have inside of my project are as follows:

CSS
1) Navigation menu that opens and closes at the click of a button. 
2) Flexbox was used to align and distribute a multitude of elements inside of the project.

JavaScript
1) A contact form was created that validates what is typed inside each input field. The contact form checks to see if fields are left blank and if they are an error message appears. If all fields are filled out an alert box appears that tells the user their message has been submitted.
2) A hamburger menu was created which shows and hides based on a click. If the hamburger menu or any link inisde the navigation menu is clicked it will hide the links and send the user to the selected part of the page. It also only works if the hamburger menu is present using a javascript media query.

Media Queries
1) Changes the navigation bar once the 600px threshold is met. Removes the hamburger button and replaces it with the links that are hidden. The links work the same way except they do not disappear after clicking due to the JavaScript media query.
2) Using flexbox the about section is transformed and moves around the items contained inside the wrapper.
3) The last media query was only added to adjust the view using margins changing them from px to vw at large screen sizes.

My footer contains active links and send the user directly to my social media platforms.

Thank you for visiting my site!
